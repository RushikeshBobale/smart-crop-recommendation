# smart-crop-recommendation
This project implements a Smart Crop Recommendation System that suggests suitable crops based on soil and weather conditions. Users provide details like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, and receive crop recommendations, images, and YouTube tutorials via an interactive Gradio interface.
